A Vertex Buffer Object(VBO) format contains 1-3 formats
- 3f
- 3f 3f
- 3f 3f 2f

The first 3f means that there are 3 types of data needed, x,y,z if it's only 2f then it means x,y or another 2 combinations

The second number represent the color code, r,g,b

The third represent U and V coordinates. The U and V is the coordinates which use to texture something, for example:

   V

   |   0,1--------1,1
   |    |         |
   |    |         |   ----> this is a face of a mesh
   |    |         |
   |   0,0--------1,0
   |
